## Categorical data



~~~r
> default.stringsAsFactors()
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
[1] FALSE
~~~
{:.output}


ðŸ˜² this setting is new in R version 4 !!

We used read_csv so it was that way anyway, but there are situations where you may want to use factors, especially for MODELING and PLOTS. essentially when you want character vectors to not be alphabetical. The `forcats` package is intended to make this easier.

===

The column with the species common names is a character vector



~~~r
> str(pg_df$common)
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
 chr [1:344] "Gentoo penguin" "Gentoo penguin" "Gentoo penguin" ...
~~~
{:.output}


Plots will be sorted alphabetically, like the default ordering for factor levels in base R.



~~~r
> as.factor(pg_df$common) %>% levels()
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
[1] "Adelie Penguin"    "Chinstrap penguin" "Gentoo penguin"   
~~~
{:.output}




~~~r
> pg_df %>% 
+   ggplot(aes(x = common)) +
+   geom_bar()
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}
![ ]({% include asset.html path="images/forcats/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" %})
{:.captioned}

===

Forcats `as_factor` uses the order in which the levels appear in your data



~~~r
> as_factor(pg_df$common) %>% levels()
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
[1] "Gentoo penguin"    "Chinstrap penguin" "Adelie Penguin"   
~~~
{:.output}


Use this to make common into a factor. Notice the ordering of the bars now.



~~~r
> pg_df <- pg_df %>% 
+   mutate(common = as_factor(common))
> 
> pg_df %>% 
+   ggplot(aes(x = common)) +
+   geom_bar()
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}
![ ]({% include asset.html path="images/forcats/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" %})
{:.captioned}


===

Use `fct_infreq` to instead order the levels by how frequently they appear in the dataset.



~~~r
> pg_df %>% 
+   mutate(common = fct_infreq(common)) %>%
+   ggplot(aes(x = common)) +
+   geom_bar()
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}
![ ]({% include asset.html path="images/forcats/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" %})
{:.captioned}

===

Or more generally, `fct_reorder` to use a different variable. In this case let's order **common** by each level's median `flipper_length_mm`.



~~~r
> pg_df %>% 
+   mutate(common = fct_reorder(common, 
+     flipper_length_mm, median, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
+   ggplot(aes(x = common, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
+   geom_boxplot()
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}
![ ]({% include asset.html path="images/forcats/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" %})
{:.captioned}

## All combinations of variables

To create a table with combinations of variables, use `expand` from the tidyr package. For example:



~~~r
> pg_df %>% expand(island, sex, common)
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
# A tibble: 27 x 3
   island sex    common           
   <chr>  <chr>  <fct>            
 1 Biscoe FEMALE Gentoo penguin   
 2 Biscoe FEMALE Chinstrap penguin
 3 Biscoe FEMALE Adelie Penguin   
 4 Biscoe MALE   Gentoo penguin   
 5 Biscoe MALE   Chinstrap penguin
 6 Biscoe MALE   Adelie Penguin   
 7 Biscoe <NA>   Gentoo penguin   
 8 Biscoe <NA>   Chinstrap penguin
 9 Biscoe <NA>   Adelie Penguin   
10 Dream  FEMALE Gentoo penguin   
# â€¦ with 17 more rows
~~~
{:.output}


To only include the combinations of variables that do appear in your data, put the column names inside of the `nesting` helper function.



~~~r
pars <- pg_df %>% expand(nesting(island, sex, common))
~~~
{:title="{{ site.data.lesson.handouts[0] }}" .text-document}



~~~r
> str(pars)
~~~
{:title="Console" .input}


~~~
tibble [13 Ã— 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
 $ island: chr [1:13] "Biscoe" "Biscoe" "Biscoe" "Biscoe" ...
 $ sex   : chr [1:13] "FEMALE" "FEMALE" "MALE" "MALE" ...
 $ common: Factor w/ 3 levels "Gentoo penguin",..: 1 3 1 3 1 2 3 2 3 3 ...
~~~
{:.output}
