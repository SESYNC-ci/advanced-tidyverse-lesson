## What is the tidyverse? 

The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is an "opinonated collected of R packages designed for data science." There are multiple packages designed to tackle each stage of the data science workflow (importing, transforming, visualizing, modeling, etc.). All of the packages are unified by common design philosophies and data structures.

It is set of packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next.

Not strictly alternatives but you might compare it to: base R, which prioritizes reliability, and [data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) which prioritizes speed and concise syntax.

## Core Tidyverse

Load the tidyverse meta-package using:

```{r library, handout = 0}
library(tidyverse)
```

These are the 8 packages now loaded into your environment:

| Package    | Purpose                       |  Prominent functions | 
|------------+-------------------------------+----------------------|
| `readr`    |  read flat files              | `read_csv`, `write_csv` |
| `tidyr`    |  reshaping                    | `pivot_longer`, `pivot_wider` |
| `dplyr`    |  wrangling                    | `filter`, `select`, `summarise` |
| `ggplot2`  |  visualization                | `ggplot`, `aes` |
| `stringr`  |  control character vectors    | `str_sub`, `str_pad` |
| `tibble`   |  opinionated data frames      | `glimpse`, `rownames_to_column`|
| `forcats`  |  control categorical data     | `fct_relevel`, `fct_anon` |
| `purrr`    |  functional programming       | `map`, `walk`, `pmap` |

## Expanded tidyverse

`install.packages("tidyverse")` also installs a number of other packages with more specialized uses, as well as many package dependencies such as `fs` and `scales`.

| Purpose    | Packages                       |
|------------+-------------------------------|
| Importing data | `DBI`, `dbplyr`, `haven`, `httr`, `readxl`, `rvest`, `jsonlite`, `xml2` |
| Wrangling specific types of data | `lubridate`, `hms`, `blob` | 
| General programming | `magrittr`, `glue`, `reprex`, `rlang` |
| Modeling | `broom`, `modelr` |
| Under the hood | `pillar`, `rlang`, `cli`, `crayon` |


Ways to keep up with new developments are via the tidyverse [blog](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/), videos from the [RStudio conferences](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/), or by following the developers on Twitter.
